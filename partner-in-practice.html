                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>
                    Partner in Practice uses artificial intelligence to assist in drafting highly verifiable clinical pathways that are explicitly designed for review, refinement, and validation by subject matter experts. Crucially, the AI does not make clinical decisions; rather, it assists in structuring the decision logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final tool is entirely rules-based and deterministic—ensuring that identical patient inputs always yield the same recommendation. This approach combines the speed of AI-assisted pathway generation with the reliability of explicit IF-THEN logic, creating a system that is transparent, testable, and auditable.

                <h2>Case Study: Clinical Decision Support in Advanced Prostate Cancer</h2>
                <p>
                    Our flagship application focuses on the complex landscape of advanced prostate cancer treatment, where the field has rapidly evolved with the introduction of novel androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs): abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Treatment selection for many patients often remains a preference-sensitive, highly complex, and sometimes subjective decision. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Darolutamide</strong> may be preferred for patients with a history of seizures due to its lower penetration of the blood-brain barrier</li>
                    <li><strong>Abiraterone</strong> requires careful management of its steroid component in patients with conditions such as diabetes, severe osteoporosis, or poorly controlled heart failure</li>
                    <li><strong>Enzalutamide</strong> carries a recognized, albeit low, risk of seizures and is associated with an increased incidence of falls and fatigue, making its use unfavorable in frail elderly patients or those with a history of seizure disorders</li>
                    <li><strong>Apalutamide</strong> shares similar considerations with enzalutamide regarding seizure risk and may require careful evaluation in patients with predisposing factors</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>The ARPI Selection Process</h2>
                <p>
                    The tool streamlines the selection of ARPIs for prostate cancer by systematically querying the user on three key patient domains:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Disease Stage and Prior Therapies:</strong> Establishes the appropriate evidence base by confirming disease stage and treatment history</li>
                    <li><strong>Patient Factors:</strong> Rigorously assesses contraindications and cautions related to ARPIs, including performance status, chemotherapy fitness, cardiovascular risk, history of seizures or falls risk, and financial capacity</li>
                    <li><strong>Provider and Practical Factors:</strong> Evaluates the need for side-effect monitoring and provides automated assessment of drug-drug interactions (DDIs), essential given the complex metabolic pathways of ARPIs</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    By integrating these three domains, the tool processes complex data to yield a clear, tiered recommendation including "Treatment Selection (Recommended)", "Medications to Use with Caution", and "Those Not Recommended", thereby translating conditional guidelines into an immediate, usable clinical action plan.
                </p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Beyond Prostate Cancer</h2>
                <p>
                    Clinical pathway modules are developed not only for ARPI selection, but for several other domains within and outside urologic oncology, from side effects management in ADT, to recurrent UTI management. Other clinical decision tools are showcased even outside of urology altogether, e.g. antihypertensive selection in essential hypertension.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Benefits for Healthcare Providers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduces cognitive burden by providing structured, evidence-based guidance</li>
                    <li>Improves provider efficiency by reducing time spent cross-referencing complex DDI databases and guidelines</li>
                    <li>Ensures adherence to current standards of care</li>
                    <li>Serves an educational role with verifiable structured insights</li>
                    <li>Makes high-quality patient care more consistent</li>
                    <li>Supports clinical judgment rather than replacing it</li>

                <h2>Transparency and Reliability</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike a chatbot that might generate different answers each time, this framework applies clinical reasoning consistently, making it suitable for real-world use. The tool is not intended to replace clinical judgment, but to support it, serving an educational role with verifiable structured insights.
