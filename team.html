        <p class="hero-description">
          TranslationalAI develops clinician-led AI tools powered by LightProof SDK for verifiable, source-anchored AI outputs. Our clinical tools—Partner in Practice, LightScribe, and ChartPrepper—are deployed in production.
        </p>
        <p class="tools-intro">
          <strong>LightProof SDK</strong> enforces provenance during generation—every model statement is mapped to exact source text positions, and unverifiable spans are rejected. This prevents unverifiable output at generation time, unlike post-hoc validation tools.
        </p>
        <p class="tools-intro">
          All tools are aligned with PIPEDA privacy principles and provincial privacy requirements, with self-assessed alignment to HIPAA security protocols (not certified). They require no EMR integration and are already in daily use by clinicians.

  <!-- 
  ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES IF CSS/JS DON'T WORK:

  1. USE HTML BLOCK instead of CODE BLOCK:
     - In Squarespace, try adding an "HTML" block instead of "Code" block
     - HTML blocks sometimes have different width constraints

  2. USE EMBED BLOCK:
     - Try using an "Embed" block and paste the entire HTML
     - Embed blocks may have more flexible width options

  3. SPLIT INTO MULTIPLE BLOCKS:
     - Break the content into smaller sections
     - Use multiple blocks to work around width constraints

  4. USE SQUARESPACE'S NATIVE BLOCKS:
     - Recreate the design using Squarespace's native blocks
     - Add custom CSS in Settings > Advanced > Code Injection
