                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    TranslationalAI was founded to address the real challenges healthcare professionals face daily. We
                    build clinical AI tools that reduce administrative burden while maintaining clinical excellence,
                    designed by physicians who understand the realities of modern healthcare.
                </p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Founder</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hanmu Yan, MD FRCSC</strong> is a practicing Canadian urologist and the founder of
                    TranslationalAI. With a background in surgery and applied AI, he develops tools to solve real
                    problems physicians encounter in clinical practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The TranslationalAI suite was created with clinical precision and simplicity, designed to integrate
                    seamlessly into healthcare workflows without requiring EMR integration.

                <h2>Approach</h2>

                <p>
                    Every tool is designed with real clinical workflows in mind. We prioritize accuracy, consistency,
                    and ease of use. Our development approach emphasizes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Verifiable AI outputs with source-anchored provenance</li>
                    <li>Deterministic systems where identical inputs yield identical outputs</li>
                    <li>Privacy and security built into every component</li>
                    <li>Tools deployed in real clinical environments</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Values</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clinical First:</strong> Every decision prioritizes clinical workflows and patient
                        safety</li>
                    <li><strong>Canadian Built:</strong> Designed and hosted in Canada, with Canadian data residency
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Practical Innovation:</strong> Tools that solve real problems, not technology for its
                        own sake</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> Security and privacy are fundamental, not afterthoughts</li>
                    <li><strong>Physician-Led:</strong> Developed by practicing physicians who understand daily clinical
                        realities</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Privacy and Compliance</h2>
                <p>
                    All tools are aligned with PIPEDA privacy principles and provincial privacy requirements, with
                    self-assessed alignment to HIPAA security protocols (not certified). They require no EMR integration
                    and are already in daily use by clinicians.
