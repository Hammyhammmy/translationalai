                    <h3>What is PSA?</h3>
                    <p>PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) is a protein produced by the prostate. Elevated levels
                        <em>can</em> indicate cancer, but can also be caused by:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) - Enlargement</li>
                        <li>Prostatitis - Infection or Inflammation</li>
                        <li>Recent activity (Standard cycling, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">If your assessment suggests a need for tissue sampling, our specialty
                        is providing <strong>Rapid Access to Transperineal Biopsy</strong>. We provide the definitive
                        answer safely and without delay.</p>

                    <h3>Step 1: Specialist Consultation</h3>
                    <p>We provide urgent consultation for elevated PSA or suspicious findings. We review your history
                        and any available imaging to determine if a biopsy is immediately required.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2: Rapid Access Transperineal Biopsy</h3>
                    <p>If tissue sampling is required, we provide <strong>Rapid Access to Transperineal Biopsy</strong>
                        directly at our clinic. This approach (via the skin, not the rectum) reduces infection risk and
                        allows for precise sampling without the long wait times of hospital-based lists.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Expedited Follow-up</h3>
                    <p>Once results are available, you will have direct access to a Urologist to discuss the findings
                        and plan next steps.</p>

            <h2>Why Transperineal Biopsy?</h2>
            <p>Traditional prostate biopsies are performed transrectally, which carries a risk of sepsis. At our clinic,
                we prioritize the <strong>Transperineal</strong> approach.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lower Infection Risk:</strong> By avoiding the rectum, the risk of serious infection is
                    significantly reduced compared to transrectal biopsy.</li>
                <li><strong>Better Sampling:</strong> Accessibility to the anterior (front) part of the prostate is
                    improved, which can be missed by traditional biopsies.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Anesthesia:</strong> The procedure is performed safely under local freezing, often
                    without the need for sedation.</li>
            </ul>

                    <h3>Is the Transperineal Biopsy painful?</h3>
                    <p>While we use local freezing (anesthesia) to numb the area, <strong>discomfort is common</strong>.
                        You will likely feel pressure and stinging during the freezing process. Many patients find the
                        procedure tolerable, but bringing a support person is recommended if you are anxious about
                        medical procedures.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>How long does the procedure take?</h3>
                    <p>The procedure takes 20-30 minutes. You should <strong>allot 60-90 minutes</strong> for your
                        entire visit to account for preparation and post-procedure monitoring.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>When can I resume normal activities?</h3>
                    <p>We strongly advise you <strong>arrange a ride home</strong> rather than driving yourself. You
                        should plan for 24-48 hours of rest. Avoid heavy lifting, vigorous exercise, and cycling for
                        <strong>at least 7 days</strong>. After that, assess how your body feels before resuming
                        strenuous activities. Everyone heals differently.
