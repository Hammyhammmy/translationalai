            <h2>Understanding Hematuria</h2>
            <p>Seeing blood in your urine can be alarming. While it is a "red flag" symptom that must be investigated to
                rule out cancer, there are many other common causes:</p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):</strong> Common and easily treated.</li>
                <li><strong>Kidney Stones:</strong> Can cause bleeding as they pass.</li>
                <li><strong>Enlarged Prostate (BPH):</strong> Benign growth can cause bleeding in older men.</li>
            </ul>

                    <h3>Step 1: Streamlined Referral</h3>
                    <p>We process hematuria referrals urgently. Our goal is to minimize the time between seeing blood
                        and seeing a specialist.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>Step 2: Rapid Access Cystoscopy</h3>
                    <p>We offer <strong>expedited access</strong> to cystoscopy suites. This allows us to visualize the
                        bladder and rule out bladder cancer much faster than standard wait times.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>Step 3: Coordinated Imaging</h3>
                    <p>If you haven't had upper tract imaging yet, we organize the appropriate requisitions to navigate
                        the public imaging queues efficiently. If imaging is already done, we review it promptly.</p>

            <h2>Why Rush?</h2>
            <p>Visible blood in the urine (Gross Hematuria) is a cardinal sign of bladder or kidney cancer until proven
                otherwise.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Detection:</strong> Bladder cancer is highly treatable when caught early.</li>
                <li><strong>One-Stop Clinic:</strong> We aim to coordinate your imaging and cystoscopy to minimize
                    visits.</li>
                <li><strong>Expert Care:</strong> Our urologists specialize in uro-oncology and endoscopic surgery.</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>Is the Cystoscopy painful?</h3>
                    <p>It can be uncomfortable, especially for men. We use a freezing gel, but you may still feel
                        pressure or a stinging sensation. It is a very quick procedure (1-2 minutes) but we do not want
                        to minimize the fact that it is invasive.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>Do I need to fast?</h3>
                    <p>Generally, no. However, if you have been scheduled for a procedure under sedation (rare for
                        diagnostic cystoscopy), you will receive specific fasting instructions. Otherwise, stay
                        hydrated.</p>
