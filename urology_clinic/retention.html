                    <h3>Step 1: Assessment & Medication</h3>
                    <p>Unless contraindicated, all patients are started on alpha-blockers to relax the prostate and
                        improve the success of catheter removal.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2: Trial of Void (TOV)</h3>
                    <p>A "Trial Without Catheter" (TWOC) is performed in a safe, monitored environment to see if the
                        patient can void on their own.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Surgical Planning</h3>
                    <p>If retention persists, we offer surgical solutions including <strong>Traditional TURP</strong>,
                        <strong>Greenlight Laser Photoselective Vaporization</strong> (we are a high-volume Greenlight
                        center), and <strong>Rezum Water Vapor Therapy</strong> for select cases.

            <h2>Why Specialized Care?</h2>
            <p>Living with a catheter is uncomfortable and carries a risk of infection. We aim to get you catheter-free
                as soon as possible.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dedicated Slots:</strong> We reserve specific times for TOV appointments to avoid ED visits.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Care:</strong> We manage the underlying cause (BPH) not just the symptom.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Education:</strong> We provide training on self-management if temporary
                    catheterization is still needed.</li>

                    <h3>Will the catheter come out at my first visit?</h3>
                    <p>We perform a Trial of Void (TOV) to <em>attempt</em> removal. Success depends on many factors. We
                        cannot guarantee you will leave catheter-free, but we will have a plan in place if retention
                        persists.</p>

                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>What if I fail the trial?</h3>
                    <p>If you cannot urinate, the catheter must be replaced to protect your kidneys. We will then
                        discuss surgical options (TURP, Greenlight, or Rezum) or teach you Clean Intermittent
                        Catheterization (CIC) for better independence.</p>
