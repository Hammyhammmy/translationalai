# MEDICAL CONTENT PRINCIPLES

## Realism & Conservative Advice
- Acknowledges individual variation in healing
- Avoids giving a fixed timeline that might not apply to everyone
- Never minimizes discomfort or complications ("we do not want to minimize the fact that it is invasive")
- Sets realistic expectations (e.g., "arrange a ride home" not "drive yourself")
- Uses conservative recovery timelines (e.g., "at least 7 days" then "assess how your body feels")
- Avoids over-promising on outcomes ("cannot guarantee," "depends on many factors")

## Honest Scope of Services
- Only claims what the clinic directly controls (e.g., "Rapid Access to Transperineal Biopsy")
- Acknowledges public system limitations (e.g., MRI wait times are system-dependent)
- Differentiates between clinic-provided services vs. coordinated services
- No false promises about system-wide speed improvements

## Professional Tone
- Removes marketing filler ("Focus requires precision," "Near-zero infection")
- Uses comparative language instead of absolutes ("Lower infection risk than..." not "Near-zero")
- Factual over salesy ("reduces infection risk" not "dramatically reduces")
- Avoids hyperbole and unsubstantiated claims

## Physician-Centric Referral
- Strictly requires physician referral (no self-referrals)
- Makes referral as easy as possible (accepts standard forms, no special PDF required)
- Provides MD Advice Line for pre-referral triage questions
- Enforces strict PHI privacy (no patient identifiers, physician license # required)

# TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

## Single Source of Truth
- All contact information in ONE file: `contacts.json`
- All navigation in ONE file: `nav-loader.js`
- All referral widgets in ONE file: `contact-loader.js`
- All layout fixes in ONE file: `layout-fix.js`

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Navigation HTML is dynamically injected, not hardcoded on every page
- Referral widget uses `.referral-widget-container` placeholder, content injected by JS
- Contact info (fax, email) populated from JSON, not hardcoded
- Shared scripts loaded once, not duplicated inline

## Maintainability
- To update fax number: edit ONE line in `contacts.json`
- To add a new pathway: edit ONE array in `nav-loader.js`
- To change referral widget: edit ONE template in `contact-loader.js`
- HTML files are clean, minimal, and focused on content only

## Separation of Concerns
- **Data**: `contacts.json` (contact info)
- **Behavior**: `*.js` files (dynamic functionality)
- **Structure**: `*.html` files (content only, minimal inline styles)
- **Presentation**: `styles.css` (shared styling)

## User Experience
- Interstitial modal for MD Advice (explains service before opening email)
- Pre-filled email templates with strict privacy warnings
- Dynamic active state detection in navigation
- Consistent hero section centering across all pages

## Portability
- All assets (CSS, JS, JSON) are local to `urology_clinic/` folder
- No dependencies on parent project
- Can be deployed independently
- All links are relative, not absolute
