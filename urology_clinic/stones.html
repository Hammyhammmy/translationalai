            <h2>Understanding Obstruction</h2>
            <p>Kidney stones can block the ureter (the tube draining the kidney), causing severe pain (colic) and
                potential kidney damage.</p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Septic Stone (Fever + Obstruction):</strong> This is a medical emergency. Go to the
                    Emergency Department immediately for IV antibiotics and urgent drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>Obstructing Stone (No Fever):</strong> Severe pain without fever can be managed through our
                    clinic with scheduled stenting or stone removal.</li>

                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>Step 1: Assessment & Imaging</h3>
                    <p>We review available imaging (CT, ultrasound) to confirm stone size and location. If imaging
                        hasn't been done yet, we can arrange it. <strong>Note:</strong> If you have fever with
                        obstruction or uncontrollable pain, go to the Emergency Department first for acute
                        stabilization.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>Step 2: Decompression (When Indicated)</h3>
                    <p>For stones that cannot pass and are causing persistent symptoms, we can arrange <strong>ureteral
                            stent</strong> placement to drain the kidney. This is typically scheduled within days, not
                        same-day emergency care.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>Step 3: Stone Removal</h3>
                    <p>Once stable, we perform definitive management including <strong>Ureteroscopy (Laser
                            Lithotripsy)</strong> or <strong>Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL)</strong> for larger
                        renal stones. <em>(Note: We do not offer Shockwave/ESWL at this site).</em></p>

                <div class="benefit">
                    <h3>Is a stent uncomfortable?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, ureteral stents can cause bladder irritation, urgency, and flank ache. Tolerance varies
                        significantly between individuals. They are a temporary necessity to protect the kidney. We aim
                        to keep them in for the shortest time specific to your case.</p>

                    <h3>Will the stone pass on its own?</h3>
                    <p>Stones under 5mm have a reasonable chance of passing spontaneously, though this varies by
                        individual anatomy and stone location. Stones over 5mm or those causing unmanageable pain
                        usually require intervention.</p>
